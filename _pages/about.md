I am currently a third-year computer science student at CUHK. During my undergraduate study, I have explored various research topics, incluidng multi-agent systems, adversarial machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). I am especially interested in NLP and hope to continue my postgraduate research on the topic. My goal is to become a computational linguist in the future.
